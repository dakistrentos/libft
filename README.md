# libft

Libft project from Codam
succeded with 115%


Summary: The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that
you’ll be allowed to use in all your other projects.

This is the first project at Codam (2020 cohort). The subject is to create your own library "libft.a" which contains useful functions.
Some of them are the re-coded versions of the originals C functions while some others are new useful functions. 

Part 1

Reproduce the following libc functions (These functions do not need any external functions):
- memset
- bzero
- memcpy
- memccpy
- memmove
- memchr
- memcmp
- strlen
- strlcpy
- strlcat
- strchr
- strrchr
- strnstr
- strncmp
- atoi
- isalpha
- isdigit
- isalnum
- isascii
- isprint
- toupper
- tolower

Also re-code the following functions, using the function “malloc”:
- calloc
- strdup

Part 2

Additional functions (check the comments inside source files):
- ft_substr
- ft_strjoin
- ft_strtrim
- ft_split
- ft_itoa
- ft_strmapi
- ft_putchar_fd
- ft_putstr_fd
- ft_putendl_fd
- ft_putnbr_fd

Bonus Part

A few more functions to manipulate lists:
- ft_lstnew
- ft_lstadd_front
- ft_lstsize
- ft_lstlast
- ft_lstadd_back
- ft_lstdelone
- ft_lstclear
- ft_lstiter
- ft_lstmap

All code must be written according to the "Norm" which is a set of rules for indentation, size of functions, formatting (and just to make it more difficult) etc.
some of the rules are:
- maximum number of functions per file: 5
- maximum number of lines per function: 25 (between and with the curly brackets)
- 'for', 'do...while', 'case', 'switch' and 'goto' are all forbidden!! 

To successfully pass the project you have to be evaluated from 3 random peers and finally from "moulinette" (a very tough tester program) all at 100%! 
(for exammple 95% is considered a faillure!)
